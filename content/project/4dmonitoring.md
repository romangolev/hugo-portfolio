BIM Technology now is well beyond 3D modelling and design automation. It has made a step forward and now is being widely used on construction sites all over the place. As one of many BIM scenarios, Construction Monitoring has a very important use and can be utilized not only as an addition for a regular report to stakeholders, but also for engineering team. Elements can be filtered by date constructed and
Below, you can see an animated images of construction. Element painted blue had been constructed in the defined time span (weekly or monthly). Green elements had been constructed in a previous period. Red elements are the elements that are going to be constructed for the next of the selected period.
A very challenging part in this approach is to split concrete elements the way they are being poured on site. It does not necessarily have to be the division made by design team, so in order to make it happen, there should be a good communication bridge between site engineers and designers.

This approach not only gives the ability to visualize construction process, but also gives an ability to export material take-offs for the each period of time. Which gives an advantage in further work and budget planning.

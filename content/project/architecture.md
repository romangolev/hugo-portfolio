BIM fosters collaboration among architects, engineers, contractors, and clients. It serves as a central hub for information sharing, allowing real-time communication, addressing conflicts, and incorporating feedback. This collaborative approach enhances teamwork, reduces errors, and ensures smooth project progress.

The [pyRevit](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit) extension is an application on top of Autodesk Revit
that gives on ability to create extensions using Python scripts. pyRevit manages application and add-ins using RevitAPI.
My extension for pyRevit is an essence of my Python Scripts developed for Dynamo to extend the functionality of Autodesk Revit.
There are scripts that automate routines tasks for architects, interior designers and BIM coordinators.

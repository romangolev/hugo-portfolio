#### Introduction

With a background spanning four years in coding, I've cultivated a deep expertise encompassing application creation, debugging, deployment, and maintenance. Fearless when it comes to tackling intricate tasks, I consistently go the extra mile to ensure the optimal delivery of applications. My proficiency extends to cloud technologies, and I possess a solid grasp of web application architecture. During my leisure time, I engage in app development and actively contribute to the open-source community. My journey began with Python, which I initially employed for automating routine tasks. Since then, I've continuously expanded my skill set by delving into new libraries and programming languages. Drawing from my engineering background, I have a natural inclination for data structuring, while my collaborative nature makes me a valuable asset in team settings.

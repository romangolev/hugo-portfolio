## [RG Tools](https://github.com/romangolev/RG-Tools) release v1.0.0

I am excited to present my new Revit Add-in RG Tools. It's a bundle of tools and enhancements for Revit that helps ease the process of BIM Coordination. It has some similarfunctionality like [pyArchitect](https://github.com/romangolev/pyArchitect), but does not rely on any other dependencies. You can simply install the .msi file attached to the release on the Github and give it a go! 

The application mostly developed using MVVM principles to facilitate all the operation logic outside the logic class behind WPF windows. Also the app is build with the support of multiple Revit versions.

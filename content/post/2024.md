## I have started a new position as BIM Software Engineer at [011h](https://www.011h.com/)

Let's bring sustainable construction to our world! It's time to think about the mother nature and spread the construction of environmentally friendly buildings. As a team of enthusiasts we will be bringing our automation tools in order to recude the impact of global warming done to the atmosphere. By using prefabrecated construction units from ecological materials and by using design automation we save working hours for both construction and preconstruction processes as well as reducing the overall carbon footprint.
